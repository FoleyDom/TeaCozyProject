# TeaCozyProject

Hello this is a project from codecademy for practice using flex selectors. 

CSS is very rough but I'm happy with completing this project and any advice on how to make it better is welcomed.

The locations section caused me alot of problems but I did the best I could do.

Thank you for viewing.
